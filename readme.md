Process Discovery with Differential Privacy (PDDP) 
=========================================================
This project contains two components:
  
* PDDP: A C# REST server component providing differential privacy guarantees for two common queries on (XES)[http://www.xes-standard.org/openxes/start] event logs. 
* PINQ:	Privacy Integrated Queries library as released by (Microsoft Research)[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/privacy-integrated-queries-pinq/].
